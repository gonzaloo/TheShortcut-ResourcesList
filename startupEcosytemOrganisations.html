	<h2>What we mean by "startup"</h2>
 
 <div><p>Steve Blank’s definition:<br>
 A startup is a temporary organization used to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.

<p><strong>Four types of new companies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lifestyle Companies: Work to Live Their Passion<br>
- freelancers, consultants, “artists”</li>

<li>Small Businesses: Work to Feed the Family<br>
- grocery stores, small restaurants, hairdressers, plumbers, electricians</li>

<li>Scalable Startups: Born to Be Big<br>
- Unlike small-business entrepreneurs, their interest is not in earning a living but rather in creating equity in a company that eventually will become publicly traded or acquired, generating a multi-million-dollar payoff.</li>

<li>Social Entrepreneurs: Driven to Make a Difference<br>
- their goal is to make the world a better place, not to take market share or to create to wealth for the founders</li>
</ul>
